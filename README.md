This is a candle flicker animation for Adafruit Circuit Playground Express.
All ten NeoPixels are used. Each is an independent candle simulation,
running in parallel with co-operative multitasking (coroutines).

The candle simulation is based on code by Tim Bartlett, see http://timbartlett.net/ledcandle/

Build this with the Arduino IDE. The Adafruit Circuit Playground library is
required, along with the coroutines library in this repository.
