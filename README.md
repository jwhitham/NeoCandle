This is a candle flicker animation for various small boards,
always involving the colourful WS2812B LEDs or Adafruit "NeoPixels".
I used this to make various Christmas gifts. The first generation
of these devices always used Adafruit "Circuit Playground Express"
hardware, which is very nice but rather expensive. Later generations
used Arduino Nano boards with generic WS2812B LEDs, and in one
case I reused an old Raspberry Pi.
